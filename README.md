# RokuLightningJS
How to transition, and setup, a Roku Brightscript and scenegraph app to LightningJS.

I can't find any good documentation for Roku LightningJS, so I will make my own! Any contributions, typos, errors, please point out and help build this repo of information, including boilerplate and eventually starter templates. End goal is for a full CI/CD pipeline for all three platforms (Roku, Android TV, and Fire TV) to test, build, and deploy all versions automatically. 

Long way to go but every journey starts with a single step.

Roadmap
 Create minimal BrightScript wrapper

 Automate build steps with scripts

 CI/CD pipeline for .zip and .apk generation
